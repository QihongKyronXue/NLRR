# NLRR: A Novel Autonomous Driving Decision-Making Framework

Welcome to the repository for **NLRR**, an innovative decision-making framework designed for autonomous driving systems. 🚗💡

## About the Project

The NLRR framework is a cutting-edge approach tailored to enhance the efficiency and reliability of decision-making in autonomous vehicles. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques, this framework aims to address critical challenges in the autonomous driving domain, including:

- Real-time decision optimization
- Adaptive responses to dynamic environments
- Robust handling of uncertainties and edge cases

### Current Status
- 🔬 **Experiments**: Ongoing evaluations to validate the framework's performance across diverse driving scenarios.  
- 📝 **Paper**: Currently under development, documenting our methods, findings, and key contributions.

## Future Plans

We are committed to fostering transparency and collaboration in the research community. Although the code is not yet publicly available, we aim to **open-source the NLRR framework** upon the completion of our experiments and publication of our paper.

Stay tuned for updates!

## How to Cite

If you are interested in referencing NLRR in your work, please keep an eye out for the forthcoming publication. Citation details will be added here once the paper is published.

## Get Involved

We welcome collaboration and constructive feedback. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in our work or have questions about the framework.
